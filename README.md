# DESCRIPTION OF TASKS
---
This task demonstrates the simulation of a collaborative design workflow using Figma's built-in collaboration tools. The project centers around designing a mobile onboarding screen for a productivity app called TaskFlow, which helps users manage tasks more efficiently.

üßë‚Äçüíª Project: TaskFlow ‚Äì Mobile Onboarding Screen
The screen welcomes users with a clean and modern UI. Key content includes:

App icon and branding

A clear and engaging headline: "Welcome to TaskFlow"

Supporting subtext highlighting product benefits

Primary CTA: ‚ÄúStart Your Journey‚Äù

Option to skip the onboarding step

üõ†Ô∏è Collaboration Workflow Features Demonstrated:
Live Team Collaboration:
Multiple team members (SA, JE, MK) collaborated in real-time.

Version History Management:
The design evolved through multiple versions (shown here: v3) using Figma's version control to track and review progress.

Commenting System:
Feedback was added directly on design elements using pin comments for better precision and actionable suggestions.

Component Reusability & Styles:
Best practices such as:

Descriptive naming conventions (Welcome_Screen, Button/Primary)

Use of reusable components and variant styles

Team library documentation for consistent design standards

‚úÖ Key Learnings:
Improved clarity in team communication through comments and tags

Structured versioning enabled better iteration tracking

Leveraging the team library streamlined updates across components
